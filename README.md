This is a project in Python language for digital electronics course 3 University ibagu√©, our goal was to access the different signals that gives us the bracelet (MYO) to give an application this was achieved move the Jumping Sumo (of the company Parrot) ...
If you use this project and is not a native linux (virtual machine) you must configure the serial port of the machine where you will place the module of the MYO correctly, if you omit this native linux.
Also to help save time and better or work with our project to keep in mind that all compressed codes that are in the link when you run MyoConnect.py must be in the same folder.
